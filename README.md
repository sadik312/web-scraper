### Python Web-Scraper
Libraries:
- BeautifulSoup - scraping library for Python:w

- Will be running scraping program in a virtual environment, to be isolated
- BeautifulSoup runs on top of an HTML or XLM parser which allows you to write idiomatic Python to interact with and manipulate the parse tree

### Creating a virtual environment (because I always forget)
- Create virtual environment
    `python3 -m venv envName`
- Change directory into created env
    `cd envName`
- Activate virtual environment
    `source bin/activate`

### Install BeautifulSoup
- `pip install beautifulsoup4`
